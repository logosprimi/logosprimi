Quotes don't nest as such: putting a single quote character inside a double-quoted string doesn't
start a single-quoted string, it just stands for itself.
However, if you use shell commands such as "eval" and "trap" then you will find that you have to
write quotes within quotes sometimes; it's very easy to get confused if you do this, as the inner
quoting characters themselves must be quoted properly.
The approach to take is decide exactly what the command you want eval or trap to execute is; then
considering it as a string of characters, rather than as a command, add quoting as necessary to
remove special meaning from all special characters.
Consider this command:
echo \\ `echo spong`\
